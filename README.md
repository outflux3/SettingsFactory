Settings Factory for ProcessWire CMS
=======================

### Create unlimited settings pages!

Ever wanted to build some functionality for a site, but need some user editable settings, and don't want to add new fields, and don't want to build a module?  Maybe you are building a service that pulls data from an external site and need to have a place to store some items like URL, or preferences settings.

Need a place to enter some data to be used for site schema (schema.org)?

Need an easy way to provide access to those settings panels right from the PW admin menu?

Need to be able to reuse the same settings panels on various sites without having to create fields?

Settings Factory is your answer.

## Instructions

1. Create a page under Admin (at the top level or under Setup if you prefer), e.g. "Weather Widget".

2. Save the page and then choose **ProcessSettingsFactory** process from the dropdown.

3. Enter the path to your settings file â€“ the path is relative to the templates folder, e.g. /settings/weather-widget.json

## How to use on front end

1. Make sure your settings panel works without errors in the admin, and populate the various fields, and save. The data is saved in the Settings Factory module config.

2. Init the module on the front end by setting up a varible to access your settings.

```
$factory = $modules->get("SettingsFactory");
$siteSettings = $factory->getSettings('name-of-my-settings');
```
** note that the name of your settings matches the name of the process page, so if you named your process page "weather-widget", then your settings would be called like this:

```
$factory = $modules->get("SettingsFactory");
$wSettings = $factory->getSettings('weather-widget');
```

3. Use it in your template as follows, where `text1` refers to a key in your settings
```
<php echo $wSettings->text1; ?>
```

the settings are delivered as a WireArray, or can be delivered as a plain array getSettingsArray('name-of-process);
